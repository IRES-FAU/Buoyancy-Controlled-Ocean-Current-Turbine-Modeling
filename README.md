# Buoyancy-Controlled-Ocean-Current-Turbine-Modeling
This repository contains a numerical modeling of a buoyancy controlled ocean current turbine (OCT), simulated through Simulink in Matlab. The OCT system is a 7 DOF sysetm, including a variable buoyancy tank, variable pitch rotor, main body, and a 607 m mooring cable attached to the ocean floor at a depth of 325 m, as shown in Figure.
